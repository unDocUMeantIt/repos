ChangeLog for package koRpus.lang.en

changes in version 0.1-4 (2020-10-24)
fixed:
  - removed hard coded abbreviations from global TT.tknz.opts in preset, to
    enable checks for file names by koRpus
  - added missing BNC tag AJS and 15 ambiguity tags
changed:
  - removed the lexicon lookup from the preset, as it is also no longer part
    of the TreeTagger script
  - renamed abbreviations and parameter files omitting the "-utf8" suffix

changes in version 0.1-3 (2019-05-13)
changed:
  - reverted temporary transitional changes from 0.1-2
added:
  - now also supports the BNC tagset (thanks to Elen Le Foll)
  - added missing PENN tags NNP, NNPS, and PRP$, and explained why koRpus
    defaults to the BNC definition for the conflicting tag PRP in the
    documentation. 

changes in version 0.1-2 (2018-03-20)
fixed:
  - package name in license header
changed:
  - updated README.md
added:
  - support optional arguments for koRpus::set.lang.support()
temporary:
  - this is planned to be a CRAN-only transitional release. since this
    package needs koRpus >=0.11-2 but the CRAN version (0.10-2) should be upgraded
    after this package was already accepted, we'll work around this by
    deactivating functionality unavailable to older koRpus versions, if such an old
    package is used
  - temporarily lowered koRpus dependency to 0.10-2
  - added a check for koRpus version to .onAttach(), so that the language
    support which is already present won't be tampered with; i.e., you can safely
    load this package with older koRpus packages, it just won't add anything

changes in version 0.1-1 (2018-01-05)
changed:
  - initial release as standalone package
